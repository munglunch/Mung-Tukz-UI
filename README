To Do:
1. Add more class-specific options similar to the IF and VE warnings.
2. Allow the chat windows to be moved
3. Change the data-statusbars to allow for mobility 
4. Add more informative statusbars to the collection as options.
	-4a-Regent counters
	-4b-soulstone/ammo counters (not sure though since these will be obsolete in cata)
	-4c-Statusbar showing incoming debuff urgency
5. SinnisterrUI :)
6. Minimap addon toggles need to be honed.
7. Re-anchor QBar (I hate its current location)
8. Skada is extremely restricted, I need to come up with another scheme.
